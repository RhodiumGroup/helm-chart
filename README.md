[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/RhodiumGroup/helm-chart.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RhodiumGroup/helm-chart)

**NOTE:** This repo is in the process of being phased out in favor of https://github.com/RhodiumGroup/daskhub-rhg-config. As of 1/20/21, this repo is being used for minor updates to our `staging` and `impactlab` clusters, while the other repo has incorporated a version bump to the `daskhub` helm-chart that we deploy and is being deployed to the `adrastea` cluster via Argo CD. Once that new deployment approach has been tested, it will be used for all clusters and this repo will be archived.
